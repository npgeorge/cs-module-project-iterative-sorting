"""
Steps for computing Big-O:
​
1. Wrote down the big O of each line in isolation
   * Loops get O(n)
   * Most other single lines get O(1)
2. Add the big O of things in series/sequence
3. Multiply the big O of each loop by its body
​
Also, drop constant multipliers.
Also, drop non-dominant terms in a sum.
